#  Food Delivery Time Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes and models food delivery data to understand factors influencing delivery time. It explores correlations, statistical relationships, and predictive modeling to optimize delivery efficiency.

##  Dataset
The dataset used is `Food_Delivery_Times.csv`, which includes attributes like:
- `Preparation_Time_min`
- `Delivery_Time_min`
- `Time_of_Day`
- `Weather_Conditions`
- `Distance_km`
- and more...

##  Key Analysis Steps

-  **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed rows with missing values.
  - Verified data types and structure.

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Value counts of `Time_of_Day`
  - Shape and structure of data

-  **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Used **Pearson correlation** to analyze how different numerical columns affect `Preparation_Time_min`.

-  **Statistical Testing**:
  - Planned use of **ANOVA tests** for categorical features like `Weather_Conditions` (as mentioned in markdown).

-  **Predictive Modeling (Planned)**:
  - Goal to build a **Delivery Time Predictor** using relevant features.

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy

## 📁 File Structure
- `Food_Delivery.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.
